my name is Karen singer and I am a computer engineering major in my senior year I'm graduating with experience of hardware and software but I broke recently decided that I'd like to genuine software pass after an intership where I did get to work on software projects I still do have experience and enjoy hardware and software but I think I would like to take more course work in software and maybe go to grad school for computer graphics and computer science rather than your engineering I'm really interesting opportunities learning more about software and animation and animatronics and I take enforce works in robotics which is good to me. Of microprocessors and SVGA design as well as programming I understand the electrical background of love the computerized and programming background so that's something that I really like to work in
